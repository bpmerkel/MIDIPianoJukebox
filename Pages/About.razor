            So my wife purchased a Baby Grand Player Piano, and much to my delight, it included a MIDI connection.
            Then, I inherited a PC from my father where he had accumulated over 170,000 MIDI files from varying genres.

        <MudText Typo="Typo.body1" Class="mb-4">
            Thus commenced my challenge: to create a MIDI Jukebox app to navigate through the thousands of MIDI files,
            enable rating, and display any metadata that could help me sort and filter through them all. I found a few small apps that were file
            and folder-based, but none that gave a comprehensive Jukebox experience with customizable Playlists, a queue, and the ability to
            rate songs as they were played (some of the MIDI songs just don't fit my taste for the Piano).

            And since Blazor was released, I knew the time was nigh to craft a Jukebox web application, where
            I could run on a laptop with a USB MIDI adapter into the piano. That's right--this is a dedicated web
            server that runs on the device hard-connected to the Piano.

            I first started with LINQPad to try out some MIDI NuGet packages to comb through the MIDI files... and then to play
            the MIDI files through Windows' sequencer, and then switched to the USB MIDI adapter into the piano.
